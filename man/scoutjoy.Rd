\title{Significant Cross-trait OUtliers and Trends in JOint York regression (SCOUTJOY)}
\usage{
scoutjoy(BetaOutcome, BetaExposure, SdOutcome, SdExposure, data,
  ids = NULL, CovIntercept = 0, ExposureIntercept = 1,
  OutcomeIntercept = 1, OutlierNull = "estimate",
  SignifThreshold = 0.05, NullReplicates = NA, maxOutlierReps = 10,
  seed = NULL, printProgress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{BetaOutcome}{String, giving the column name in `data` for the effect sizes (betas) on the outcome (y-axis trait)}

\item{BetaExposure}{String, giving the column name in `data` for the effect sizes (betas) on the exposure (x-axis trait)}

\item{SdOutcome}{String, giving the column name in `data` for the standard error (se) of the effect sizes on the outcome (y-axis trait)}

\item{SdExposure}{String, giving the column name in `data` for the standard error (se) of the effect sizes on the exposure (x-axis trait)}

\item{data}{Data frame with the specified column names containing effect sizes and standard errors}

\item{ids}{(Optional) string giving the column name in `data` of variant IDs to use for labeling results tables}

\item{CovIntercept}{Intercept from LD score regression for genetic correlation between the two phenotypes. Default = 0 corresponds to assuming no sample overlap or correlated confounding.}

\item{ExposureIntercept}{Intercept from univariate LD score regression of the exposure phenotype. Used for estimate of correlated error (default = 1).}

\item{OutcomeIntercept}{Intercept from univariate LD score regression of the outcome phenotype. Used for estimate of correlated error (default = 1).}

\item{OutlierNull}{String, either "estimate" or "fitted", indicating which null hypothesis to use in outlier testing. Recommended default is "estimate". See Details.}

\item{SignifThreshold}{Significance threshold for testing outlier status,prior to multiple testing correction (default = 0.05).}

\item{NullReplicates}{Number of simulated null replicates to use for hypothesis testing. If NA (default), analytic tests are used rather than simulated replicates.}

\item{maxOutlierReps}{Maximum number of iterations to use when idenfiying stable outlier set (default = 10).}

\item{seed}{Random seed, for use with simulated null.}

\item{printProgress}{Logical, whether to print logging messages.}
}
\value{
Structured list with elements:
\describe{

  \item{\code{Global Test}}{Data frame with results for the test of overall heterogeneity in the York regression. Provides values `RSSobs`, the weighted residual sum of squares observed, and the corresponding `Pvalue` for the test of excess heterogeneity.}
  
  \item{\code{Slope Estimates}}{Data frame with regression results. Includes York regression results for all variants and excluding outliers, as well as Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) and Egger regression for comparison.}
  
  \item{\code{Outlier Tests}}{Data frame containing the input effect sizes and standard errors along with the observed weighted residuals and corresponding P-values for the initial York regression (including all variants) and the final York regression after outlier exclusions. NA values indicate failed convergence. If `ids` were provided, they are present as the row names for this table.}
  
  \item{\code{Outlier Convergence}}{List with information on `Iterations`, whether the outlier testing `Converged`, the number of iterations performed (`NumberIterations`), and the signficance threshold for identifying outliers after Bonferroni correction for the number of included variants (`SignifTheshold`). `Iterations` is a data frame where each column is a variant and each row is an iteration, with true/false values indicating whether the given variants was a putative outlier in the given iteration. If the procedure converged, the final outlier selection is given by the last row.}
